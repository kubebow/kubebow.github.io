[Outro: TWQ p p]
Really think about all the interactions,
uh, between [?] and Angel
that we see in [?].
So for instance;
the entire [?] is
[?] showing Angel around.
Yet twice,
Angel goes to worship [?].
[?] tells [?] "don't, you can't worship me"
But,
[?]'s totally willing to
converse with [?]--
[?] totally willing to have a conversation with [?].
So it's clearly okay
to talk to [?];
it's not okay to worship [?].
When [?] goes to sacrifice [?],
Angel tells [?] not to
and there's a back and forth conversation between [?]
and Angel.
And Angel said, "[?] not worshiping [?]."
"[?] not worshiping [?]
...right?"
This is a really important point because a lot don't make any distinction there;
that any time you're talking to [?],
or any time you're talking to the [?],
you must be worshiping [?].
[?] having a conversation with Angel is fine,
Angel receiving a revelation from [?] is fine and good, it's inspired,
but going to worship [?] is not.
That is a really clear, uh-- and pretty
obvious kinda distinction right?
The distinction between conversation
and worship
is something we actually see in all of those times you see those interactions.
