	every second redundant flesh<br>
	is burned awayayaayyayyaya--<br>
	and every seven years the bo<br>
	-dy has been replacedaeeae<br>
	anatomical wireframe solidifies and aches<br>
	and as for the memories; assumptions take its place<br>
	<br>
	[3:chorus_1]<br>
	......<br>
	i promise you need normalcy<br>
	??????<br>
	??????<br>
	you search for meanings as the fabric shifts<br>
	but it's nowhere near the importance of your innocence<br>
	<br>
	[4:verse_2]<br>
	ones who nest above<br>
	slowly ticking almighty wheel<br>
	we throw hope at the tree to see what sticks<br>
	fall down and block our way<br>
	and as the leaves fall with dew and rain on its face<br>
	the cold water drips the sticks away<br>
	<br>

	[6:bridge]<br>
	why does it choose a world<br>
	with wireframes that solidify and ache away?<br>
	we tell ourselves that it's all to its plan<br>
	but i fear that our self-awareness is a sign<br>
	it's asking for our advice<br>
	oh no<br>
	<br>
	[10:outro]<br>
	i fear that you're meant to be up here with me<br>
	a state of knowing beyond questioning,<br>
	the human condition being the sum of floating point values<br>
	please promise me you'll take this normalcy while you have the chance<br>
	i'll be contacting you<br>
	when we have nothing left<br>
