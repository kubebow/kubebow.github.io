yo wuddup it is eye the kube of bow. I make weird concept-heavy art projects, mostly in the form of music. I'm not the greatest when it comes to stuff like quality when it comes to audio mixing, but I very much have leaned into that. I make stuff that is really heavy in aesthetics that make you remember the good times when it comes to us Gen Z'ers on the internet in the early 2010s. This is often displayed as happy as it remembers the simpler times, but nostalgia is a very negative thing too as it gets you stuck in the past. You may be enjoying something that happened, but are you enjoying where you are now? This balance is something I really struggle with IRL and i work through it using my music and art.

Kaden Brown, most commonly known by their "KubeBow" pseudonym, is an experimental electronic musician and producer from Oregon. They primarily studied Computer Science, but eventually realized their real interest in the subject was due to the love of making games as a creative art form, and not as much the analytical problem-solving based side of things. They mainly realized this during the summer break between their junior and senior years of high school, which took place in the tail-end of the initial COVID-19 pandemic. Kaden has always been interested in music, but never could make something they were proud of, so during the summer break they researched the world of music theory using online resources and, in the process, ended up finding that art and music was their real passion in life.<br>
<br>
Kaden tends to release concept-heavy projects, and doesn't stick to a particular style of music, but labels such as chiptune, EDM, IDM, lo-fi, psychedelia, progressive, glitch, and noise are all common. Kaden also partakes in mediums of art beyond music such as game development, digital visual art, and unfiction. Many of these mediums are used in conjunction in order to allow them to construct overarching stories and themes that relate to their art, such as how they often release projects that are made with a specific character in mind, and is labelled as being made by that character. (i.e. Monikers like "Ang/e_l" and "Almighty Wheel")<br>
<br>
Apart from their primary projects and discography, they also take part in many side projects. Most of these projects are tongue-in-cheek and are just made for fun, such as works under the "DJ SQARXZ" moniker, but there are a few much larger side projects that are only considered side projects due to not easily fitting into the KubeBow discography. One example of this is the project titled "Its", consisting of roughly 2 hours of avant-garde noise pieces. Initially the first part of the project ("It Hums") was mostly meant as a joke, but it ended up being a project Kaden really liked unironically. Soon afterwards, Kaden continued to release four more EPs in the spirit of "It Hums" that became the remaining parts of the "Its" series.<br>
<br>
A vast majority of the content you see on projects Kaden has worked on were made directly by them, completely solo. Sometimes they get a little help from their brother (mostly with visual assets and DJ SQARXZ related content) or gets help from someone they know online, but overall Kaden's projects are all solo. The same cannot be said about "Zone-440", however, which is an internet band they manage made up of many people that met on online communities. The band was born out of the need for their to be a small community dedicated to music feedback, which was something not many people had at the time in those particular circles. Kaden eventually decided to make a special community dedicated to this on Discord. Over time there were more and more collaborative projects and events being hosted in this community, many of which made using web-tools like Beepbox/Ultrabox. These projects were what turned Zone-440 into an internet band as opposed to a random Discord community.<br>
<br>
As of right now Zone-440 is the only form of collaborative effort Kaden has taken part in, but they have expressed their wishes to implement collaboration in many more places and projects in the future, including their main works in the KubeBow discography. Although Kaden intends to continue their pursuits in music and art with their personal projects, Kaden wants to make a living off of music however possible. They are still in the process of learning what making a living in the music business is like, but they are open to the idea of things like commission works and audio engineering, and hope they can find a role that truly fits them.
