# KubeBow GitHub Page
A Replacement for [my Carrd](https://KubeBow.carrd.co)<br>
Although the Carrd will be less frequently updated, I will keep it up (Mainly because Github Pages sometimes causes really weird artifacts in the time it takes for the site to update)
## Description
Θ I used to primarily use carrd.co to host a small website with info about me as an artist and my projects.<br>
Θ Although it's ultimately just a space to link all my accounts, I've found myself often tweaking it to suit my style as an artist.<br>
Θ I like Carrd since its easy to manage, but it also is a little limiting sometimes.<br>
Θ Recently I decided to replace my carrd with a nostalgic and ***basic*** html website, which is what this project is.<br>
Θ As of 10/27/2022, this project is no longer considered under construction and I will now be replacing the links to my Carrd on my accounts with a link to this Github Page.<br>
Θ Now that I have the basic functionality out of the way, I'm going to start working on a lot more stuff that could only be possible on a website that I have full control over.<br>
