# KubeBow GitHub Page
*A Replacement for [my Carrd](https://KubeBow.carrd.co)*
## Description
Θ Currently I use carrd.co to host a small website with info about me as an artist and my projects.<br>
Θ Although it's ultimately just a space to link all my accounts, I've found myself often tweaking it to suit my style as an artist.<br>
Θ I like Carrd since its easy to manage, but it also is a little limiting sometimes.<br>
Θ The reason why I decided to do this though is that I, being the victim of nostalgia I am, really am 
drawn to the aesthetic of *basic* html websites.<br>
Θ I also have some ideas up my sleeve, although I'll keep the specifics a surprise for now.<br>
