this is the milk tweet
im so gay that when a pretty woman shows up i get anxious that someone will go "nudge nudge isnt she cute" and then i have to explain that i'm gay

it still absolutely baffles me that LGBTQIA+ is a term that is still used as if it isn't paradoxical / "yeah i know this term that is meant to stand for inclusion explicitly gatekeeps who is worthwhile in the world.. but it's fiiiiine y'all!! we'll add a plus sign!!"
whoever is currently reading this text / idfc what shit you make, or if i'd even like it, do what you like doing you stinky head!!!!!!!!!!!!! make me angry!!!!!!!!!!!! make dumb shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! art is meant to be an act of healing not a reason to hate yourself more
