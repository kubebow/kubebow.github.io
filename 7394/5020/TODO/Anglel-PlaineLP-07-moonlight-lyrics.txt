[Intro: TWQ p p]
Rain likely tonight for western Oregon
with overnight lows in the thirties,
and continuing into Monday with afternoon temperatures tomorrow
in the low to mid forties.
For central and eastern Oregon:
Rain and snow likely early tonight.
For central Oregon: rain likely to the east,
overnight lows in the twenties.
Snow likely early for Monday for Bend and Central Oregon
with rain likely throughout the day for eastern Oregon,
afternoon temperatures tomorrow in the thirties.

[Verse 1: Ang/e_l]
The snow and ice will come quicker than hoped for.
Turn on all the lights,
board up all of the doors.
Dark bedroom getting cold;
stagnant fog,
overnight lows.
Feelings merely arbitrary.
Brain waves beat against my broken skull.

[Verse 2: Ang/e_l]
This dreary sky had come just to sicken me;
Played my loosely tuned Organ,
and felt the ground scream.
Loose signal; Is it close?
Radio wavelengths
only God knows.
I'm tripping on the fabric's seams.
Cold water drips beneath the pearly keys.

[Outro: Ang/e_l]
Rain likely tonight for west of the Organ.
