[Verse 1a]
Can you hear me?
I think I found something,
There's a gap within
the noise that we've
seen. Surroun-
-ding a neutral;
There's a pull as if
there's something else
beneath.

[Verse 1b]
I feel that I've
found a breakthrough:
Shattered signs showing
a new plane to get
to. If our floor
boards were not built
to last, maybe we can
take shelter inside
the remnants of a
dream? a
dream?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And once I
breathe...

[Chorus 1]
And once I
breathe...
I'll reposition all the
vertices that surrounded
me. There must be an-
-other me-ean-ing, O-
O-O-O-O-oh..
Let me know the difference
in the colors you see-
-ee-ee-ee... I swear
there's another. Cal-
-ibrate the colors.
Oh
no,
Oh
no,
Oh...

[Post-Chorus 1 - Instrumental]

[Verse 2a]
Can you hear me?
When is the next sunrise?
I am trapped within
the formless un-
-seen. There's noth-
-ing but cold snow.
Yet it feels as if
there's so much more
to see.

[Verse 2b]
I feel so strange
talking to you.
Who are you? Having
issues holding shape
too? With our old
doors forever
collapsed, maybe we could
start anew beside
the cyan once a-
-gain, a-
-gain...

[Bridge]
And if I--
(Vocal chops)

[Chorus 2]
And if I
breathe...
I'll reposition all the
vertices that surrounded
me. There must be an-
-other me-ean-ing, Bur-
-ied in the deep snow...
Let me know the difference
in the colors you see-
ee-ee-ee... I swear
there's another,
A feeling like no other,
Calibrate the colors.
Oh
no,
Oh
no,
Oh...

[Outro]
...no...
