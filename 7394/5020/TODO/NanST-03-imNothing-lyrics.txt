eyes oh pen
leer ick use less ness
just sharp sound
just this feel ing
i'm nothing
am i still on
this sky was poisoned
pound
sound in to my ears
this remnant of not
this punishment for the serpent
i'm breathing
out nothing
plastic bits
i'm nothing
still nothing
always not
i hear you
was this what you had asked for
this dream of what could be
i was simply the litter you threw into the street
can you hear me
my eyes not here
world keeps spinning
ever spinning
i'll find the star light
next day
and the day after
always want another day to
waste time to wait for time to
no
please
if you hear
will i be alright
hope i will
when the melted plastic
hard again
and something
and nothing
always nothing
i'm nothing
once again
i'm nothing once again
midnight carcass again
