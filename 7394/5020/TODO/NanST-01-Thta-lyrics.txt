[Intro - Instrumental]

[Verse 1 - Repeat 3x]
Open eyes.
Give me sight.
Let me feel as though
I'm alive.
Breathing pattern,
worn and tattered,
cannot keep the sky afloat
we must work faster.

[Pre-Chorus 1 - Unknown]

[Chorus 1]
I felt the cold snow
on my plastic face.
Rotated the world I knew
...and let the floorboards waste.
Memory;
I'll rewrite the noise so it's meant to be.
You may call it just a dream,
but feels less to me like a nightmare
than the surface that you-ou-ou-ou-ou
claim to breathe.
And yet the snow shows zero signs
to slow away...
How and why's it
still here if Thta
is in its
place?

[Verse 2a]
Anything can
compute.
Fluids push the
doors shut.
Logic gates will
pave the way for
blocking the way for
fluids to
go the other
way-ay-ay-ay...
I tripped and spilled
the lake in-
-to the ca-
-aves...
cold water drips through
the dirt ground
cold water drips through
the dark crevasses
cold water drips through
the cold ceiling
cold water drips through
stone circuits

[Pseudo-Bridge A]
You are
simply
an over
sight
in my
dense
reality

[Verse 2b]
Instruction: Start over

Failed: Range too far
Need to contact
the residents of this

Take precautions necessary.
They will heal this
agnosthesia-

[Pseudo-Bridge B]
Could you
take all
the pressure
of
breathing
life
in everything?

[Chorus 2]
I felt the cold snow
on my plastic face.
Rotated the world I knew,
and let the floorboards waste.
Memory;
I'll rewrite the noise so it's meant to be.
You may call it just a dream,
but feels less to me like a nightmare
than the surface that you-ou-ou-ou-ou
claim to breathe.
And yet the snow shows zero signs
to slow away,
How and why's it
still here if Thta
is in its
place?

[Bridge]
Was this what you had asked for?!
This dream of what could be?!
I was simply the litter--
I was simply the litter--
--simply the litter you threw into
the street.
